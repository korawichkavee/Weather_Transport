# Weather_Transport
This respiratory is a corresponds of my research thesis “Exploring the impact of inclement weather condition on reliability of public transport”. As I stated in the thesis, there will be no data given here on GitHub. I put my python code here so that people who will do a similar work can look at my work as an example and learn from my mistakes if you found any. 
I used interchangeably between .PY and. IPNYB.
